# CUMCM202219002024A
This repository is a collection of the CUMCM contest of team No.202219002024 which includes Yun-Zhong Qiu, Zheng-Hua Lei and Sheng-Hao Liu. All team members are from South China University of Technology School of Computer Science and technology. In this contest, we choose to solve the A problem, which is a question about **Maximum Output Power of  Wave Oscillator**.

Since our major was not Physics, we decided to start with something simple:  **the Newton Laws**. By utilizing Newton laws to analyze the movement and energy status of the oscillator systems, we can acquire a series of **Second-Order Linear Differential Equations**. In order to solve the sets of equations, we apply **Lunge-Kuta algorithm** and **Genetic Algorithms** to tackle all kinds of optimization problems.
